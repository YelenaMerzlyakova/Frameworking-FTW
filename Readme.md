## Choice of Framework

**Bootstrap** :heart:

I've chosen Bootstrap because I've heard it was the easiest one to learn and so I thought it would be the
easiest one to start with. Later on I would like to explore Foundation or maybe even some other frameworks.

Because we don't have as much time to explore (as I would like to) I had to start the excercise straight away without reading the documentation which was not such a good idea... . It would have been less time-consuming if I understood the
basic idea behind bootstrap and how it worked. 

Point Of Interest 

Bootstrap Grid.

Bootstrap grid is fairly easy the work with once you get the mechanics behind it. It's easy to manipulate and adjust hence it's pretty flexible. You do have to get a moment and read about it and how it works otherwise it will lead to a lot of 
errors and problems with the layout. 
I like how it's 12 columns, it makes it very flexible and adjustable. 

I'm a fangirl for bootstrap! :heart:
